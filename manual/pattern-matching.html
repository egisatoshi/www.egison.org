  How do you express a set in a program?
  Probably, most of you represents it as a list.
  However, a list differs from a set because it does not ignore the order of elements.
  Then, even if we want to ignore the order, we have to care about it when we represent a set as a list.
  Data types whose data have no normal form such as sets are called <i>non-free data types</i>.
  Unfortunately, it had been difficult to do pattern-matching against them in the programming languages before Egison.
  Egison gives strong pattern-matching expressive power even against those data types.
  We demonstrate it here with many examples, which contain pattern-matching for lists, multisets, and sets.

<h2 id="pattern-matching1">Pattern-Matching against Non-Free Data Types!</h2>


<p>
  In this section, we show various basic pattern-matching against collections.
</p>

<h3>The <code>cons</code> Pattern Constructor</h3>

<p>
  At first, let's execute the following code.
</p>

<textarea class="code">(match-all {1 2 3 4} (list integer)
          [<cons $x $xs> [x xs]])
;=>{[1 {2 3 4}]}

(match-all {1 2 3 4} (multiset integer)
          [<cons $x $xs> [x xs]])
;=>{[1 {2 3 4}] [2 {1 3 4}] [3 {1 2 4}] [4 {1 2 3}]}

(match-all {1 2 3 4} (set integer)
          [<cons $x $xs> [x xs]])
;=>{[1 {1 2 3 4}] [2 {1 2 3 4}] [3 {1 2 3 4}] [4 {1 2 3 4}]}</textarea>

<p>
  All of them say "divide the collection <code>{1 2 3 4}</code> into the <i>head</i> element and the rest collection".
  If we regard <code>{1 2 3 4}</code> as a list, the <i>head</i> element is <code>1</code> and the rest collection is <code>{2 3 4}</code>.
  However, if we regard the collection as a multiset, the order of the elements is igonored and the notion of a <i>head</i> element changes.
  If we take the <i>head</i> of the collection as multiset or set, we will get <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, and <code>4</code>.
  Egison returns all of them.
  Note that, the notion of the <i>rest</i> collection differs between multisets and sets.
</p>

<h3>Nested Pattern Constructors</h3>

<p>
  We can write a nested inductive pattern as follow.
  They are extracting two elements from the collection.
</p>

<textarea class="code">(match-all {1 2 3} (list integer)
  [<cons $x <cons $y _>> [x y]])
;=>{[1 2]}

(match-all {1 2 3} (multiset integer)
  [<cons $x <cons $y _>> [x y]])
;=>{[1 2] [1 3] [2 1] [2 3] [3 1] [3 2]}

(match-all {1 2 3} (set integer)
  [<cons $x <cons $y _>> [x y]])
;=>{[1 1] [1 2] [2 1] [1 3] [2 2] [3 1] [2 3] [3 2] [3 3]}</textarea>

<h3>The <code>join</code> Pattern Constructor</h3>

<p>
  There is another pattern-constructor <code>join</code> for collections.
  <code>join</code> is a pattern that divides a collection into two collections.
</p>

<textarea class="code">(match-all {1 2 3} (list integer)
  [<join $xs $ys> [xs ys]])
;=>{[{} {1 2 3}] [{1} {2 3}] [{1 2} {3}] [{1 2 3} {}]}

(match-all {1 2 3} (multiset integer)
  [<join $xs $ys> [xs ys]])
;=>{[{} {1 2 3}] [{1} {2 3}] [{2} {1 3}] [{3} {1 2}] [{1 2} {3}] [{1 3} {2}] [{2 3} {1}] [{1 2 3} {}]}

(match-all {1 2 3} (set integer)
  [<join $xs $ys> [xs ys]])
;=>{[{} {1 2 3}] [{1} {1 2 3}] [{2} {1 2 3}] [{3} {1 2 3}] [{1 2} {1 2 3}] [{1 3} {1 2 3}] [{2 1} {1 2 3}] [{2 3} {1 2 3}] [{3 1} {1 2 3}] [{1 2 3} {1 2 3}] [{3 2} {1 2 3}] [{1 3 2} {1 2 3}] [{2 1 3} {1 2 3}] [{2 3 1} {1 2 3}] [{3 1 2} {1 2 3}] [{3 2 1} {1 2 3}]}</textarea>

<p>
  You might wonder about the order of results of pattern-matching.
  Specifically, why is not the result of the first expression as follow?
</p>

<textarea class="code">{[{1 2 3} {}] [{1 2} {3}] [{1} {2 3}] [{} {1 2 3}]}</textarea>

<p>
  The reason is there is a case that the target collection is an infinite list.
  We cannot return any answers if we adopted the latter order.
</p>

<h3>The <code>snoc</code> and <code>nioj</code> Pattern Constructor</h3>

<p>
  The matcher <code>list</code> has other special pattern constructors to destruct a collection into the tail and the others.
  The inductive pattern, named <code>snoc</code>, is the "dual" of <code>cons</code>.
  Of course, since a (multi)set has no order, neither <code>multiset</code> nor <code>set</code> has <code>snoc</code>.
  Similarly, <code>list</code> also has the "dual", <code>nioj</code>, of <code>join</code>.
</p>

<textarea class="code">(match-all {1 2 3} (list integer)
  [<snoc $x $xs> [x xs]])
;=>{[3 {1 2}]}
      
(match-all {1 2 3} (list integer)
  [<nioj $xs $ys> [xs ys]])
;=>{[{} {1 2 3}] [{3} {1 2}] [{3 2} {1}] [{3 2 1} {}]}</textarea>

<p>
  The arguments of <code>snoc</code> matches with the last element of a target collection and the rest of it.
  Note that, in Egison, extraction of an element from the tail of a collection is represented in the same way as the head of it.
  A pattern constructor <code>nioj</code> is similar to <code>join</code>, and used to divide a target collection into two collections.
  The difference between <code>join</code> and <code>nioj</code> is the order of pattern-matching, as its name suggests.
  In case of <code>nioj</code>, pattern-matching is executed from the back-side of a collection.
  The order of pattern-matching is important when we do non-linear pattern-matching, which we will discuss in the next section.
</p>

<h2 id="pattern-matching2">Non-Linear Pattern-Matching against Non-Free Data Types!!</h2>

<p>
  Egison allows programmers to "bind and use" variables in a pattern.
  A pattern that contains multiple occurrences of the same variables is called a <i>non-linear pattern</i>.
  Egison is the first programming language that non-linear patterns can be used in pattern-matching for non-free data.
</p>

<h3>The First Example</h3>

<p>
  The following is the first example of non-linear patterns.
  The output of this example is the collection of numbers duplicated in the target collection.
</p>

<textarea class="code">(match-all {1 2 3 1 2} (multiset integer)
  [<cons $n <cons ,n _>> n])
;=>{1 2 1 2}</textarea>

<p>
  Egison executes pattern-matching from left to right, and a bound variable can be referred to in its right side of the pattern.
  In this example, at first, the variable <code>n</code> is bound to any element of the collection.
  Then, Egison examines the pattern <code>,n</code>.
  It places the right side of <code>$n</code>, it is evaluated to the value where <code>n</code> is bound.
  When an object matches the pattern <code>,n</code>, it is equal to the value as  <code>integer</code>.
  Therefore, after successful pattern-matching, <code>n</code> is bound to an element contained at least two in the target collection.
</p>

<p>
  We can write any expression after <code>,</code>.
  Non-linear pattern-matching against non-free data types extends the expressive power of the language so much.
  Please see <a href="http://www.egison.org/demonstrations/poker-hands.html">Poker Hands</a> demonstration.
</p>

<h3>Pattern-Matching against Nested Data Types</h3>

<p>
  Here is another example.
  We can write pattern-matching against nested non-free data types such as a list of multisets or a set of sets as the following sample code.
</p>

<textarea class="code">(match-all {{1 2 3 4 5} {4 5 1} {6 1 7 4}} (list (multiset integer))
  [<cons <cons $n _> <cons <cons ,n _> <cons <cons ,n _> <nil>>>> n])
;=>{1 4}</textarea>

<p>
  Probably, you understand how strong the pattern-matching of Egison is.
  In this chapter, we show the inductive patterns of the matchers <code>list</code>, <code>multiset</code>, and <code>set</code>.
  If you want to make your own matcher or understand matchers more deeply, please read the next chapter <a href="./matchers.html">Matchers</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="pattern-matching3">Pattern-Matching with Lexical Scoping!!</h2>

<p>
  We can reuse a pattern via a pattern-function.
  A <a href="./patterns.html#pattern-function">pattern-function</a> is a function that takes patterns and returns a pattern.
</p>

<p>
  Patterns are not first class objects.
  So we can NOT replace a pattern with an object, and vice versa.
  For example, <code>(test _)</code> is illegal, because <code>_</code> is not an object but a pattern as shown below.
  However, pattern-functions are first class objects.
  So we can define pattern-functions and apply it as an argument of a function in anywhere of programs.
</p>

<p>
  Egison programmers reuse a pattern via a pattern-function.
  Although this restriction seems to be too strict, this makes modularization of patterns clear.
</p>

<p>
  See <a href="http://www.egison.org/demonstrations/mahjong.html">Mahjong</a> demonstration to see how to use pattern-functions.
</p>

<h2 id="loop-patterns">Loop-Patterns</h2>

<p>
  Can you write a function <code>comb2</code> that takes a collection as the argument, and returns the 2-combinations of it?
  This is an easy exercise, and our answer is as follows.
</p>

<textarea class="code">(define $comb2
  (lambda [$xs]
    (match-all xs (list something) 
      [<join _ <cons $a_1 <join _ <cons $a_2 _>>>> [a_1 a_2]])))

(comb2 {1 2 3 4 5})
;=>{[1 2] [1 3] [2 3] [1 4] [2 4] [3 4] [1 5] [2 5] [3 5] [4 5]}</textarea>

<p>
  Next, can you write a <code>comb3</code>?
  You will easily rewrite <code>comb2</code> to <code>comb3</code> as follows.
</p>

<textarea class="code">(define $comb3
  (lambda [$xs]
    (match-all xs (list something) 
      [<join _ <cons $a_1 <join _ <cons $a_2 <join _ <cons $a_3 _>>>>>> [a_1 a_2 a_3]])))

(comb3 {1 2 3 4 5})
;=>{[1 2 3] [1 2 4] [1 3 4] [2 3 4] [1 2 5] [1 3 5] [1 4 5] [2 3 5] [2 4 5] [3 4 5]}</textarea>

<p>
  If you can, how about <code>comb4</code>, <code>comb5</code>, and so on?
  Patterns in these <code>combX</code> have the same form, <code>&lt;join _ &lt;cons $a_1 &lt;join _ &lt;cons $a_2 ... _&gt;...&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> and then it seems to be possible to generalize them.
  We can do such a thing using a loop-pattern.
</p>

<pre><code> (loop $<i>identifier</i> <i>range</i> <i>pattern</i> <i>pattern</i>)
</code></pre>

<p>
The arguments of a loop-pattern represent an index-variable, a range of the index, a pattern repeated, and a pattern representing the end.
When the pattern ran all range, a loop-pattern is "the same as" the last argument.
Otherwise, it is "the same as" the third argument substituted itself for <code>...</code> and the head of the second argument for the index-variable with removing the head of the second argument.
It is probably difficult to understand what it means.
Then, we give <code>comb</code> as an example, and will describe the meaning of a loop-pattern using the example.
It's roughly correct and easier to understand.
</p>

<textarea class="code">(define $comb
  (lambda [$xs $n]
    (match-all xs (list something)
      [(loop $i [1 n]
         <join _ <cons $a_i ...>>
         _)
       (map (lambda [$i] a_i) (between 1 n))])))

(comb {1 2 3 4 5} 3)
;=>{{1 2 3} {1 2 4} {1 3 4} {2 3 4} {1 2 5} {1 3 5} {1 4 5} {2 3 5} {2 4 5} {3 4 5}}
</textarea>

<p>
We consider the case <code>n</code> is three.
Then, a loop-pattern is 
</p>

<textarea class="code">(loop $i {1 2 3}
  <join _ <cons $a_i ...>>
  _)</textarea>

<p>
When the range of the index is non-null, a loop-pattern "returns" the third argument regarding <code>...</code> in the argument as the loop-pattern itself.
Since <code>{1 2 3}</code> isn't null, the above example is "evaluated to"
</p>

<textarea class="code"><join _ <cons $a_1 (loop $i [2 3]
  <join _ <cons $a_i ...>>
  _)>></textarea>

<p>
Note that in the "evaluation", the index-variable <code>i</code> is "replaced with" the head of the collection, <code>1</code> in the example.
Moreover, the collection argument of the loop-pattern loses its head.
That is, <code>{1 2 3}</code> is "replaced with" <code>{2 3}</code>
Repeating this "evaluation", 
</p>

<textarea class="code"><join _ <cons $a_1 <join _ <cons $a_2 <join _ <cons $a_3 (loop $i [3 3]
  <join _ <cons $a_i ...>>
  _)>>>>>></textarea>

<p>
In the case, the second argument of the loop-pattern is null, Egison "evaluates" the last argument <code>_</code>. Then,
</p>

<textarea class="code"><join _ <cons $a_1 <join _ <cons $a_2 <join _ <cons $a_3 _>>>>>></textarea>

<p>
It is the same as what we used in <code>comb3</code>!
Actually, since a loop-pattern is just a pattern, Egison doesn't evaluate a loop-pattern.
However, a claim that the above patterns are the same is true.
Then, recalling "the result of evaluation", we can use a loop-pattern.
</p>

<p>
In the above, we omit explanation of restriction.
<code>...</code> must be placed at the end of the second argument.
For example, <code>&lt;cons ... &lt;nil&gt;&gt;</code> is prohibited.
This restriction decides which loop-patterns a given <code>...</code> belongs to, and then allows us to write nested loop-patterns.
</p>

<p>
By the way, we can omit the last argument of a loop-pattern.
In such a case, Egison regards the last argument is <code>!_</code>, which is a pattern that no objects match.
For example,
</p>

<textarea class="code">(loop $i [1 n]
  <join _ <cons $a_i ...>>)</textarea>

<p>
is interpreted as 
</p>

<textarea class="code">(loop $i [1 n]
  <join _ <cons $a_i ...>>
  !_)</textarea>
