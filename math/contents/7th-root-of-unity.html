<h2>Calculating the 7th Root of Unity</h2>

<p>
  On the 7th root of unity, the following equation is known.
</p>

`cos((2pi)/7) = 1/6 (-1 + root 3 ((7 + 21 sqrt 3 i) / 2) + root 3 ((7 - 21 sqrt 3 i) / 2))`

<p>
  We calculate this value in the following code.<br/>
  We utilize the fact that the Galois group of the following equation has same structure with the multiplicative group of `ZZ//7ZZ-{0}`.
</p>


`x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0`

<h2>One more way to solve the equation</h2>

<p>
  `ZZ//7ZZ-{0}` has two normal subgroups whose order are 2 and 3.<br/>
  The above program uses symmetry derived from the normal subgroup whose order is 2 at first.<br/>
  The following program uses symmetry derived from the normal subgroup whose order is 3 at first.
